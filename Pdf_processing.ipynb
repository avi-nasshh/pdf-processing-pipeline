      "Summary: The effective refractory period (ERP), which is important in understanding the electrical activity of the heart, is divided into different phases. Phase 4, characterized by depolarization, involves conduction through the His-Purkinje system, atria, and AV node. The SA node, known as the natural pacemaker of the heart, is responsible for initiating the heartbeat. It's worth noting that the slope of the ERP is lower in the ventricles compared to other regions. In terms of interpreting an electrocardiogram (ECG), the ST segment is isoelectric, indicating the point of ventricular depolarization. In cases of hypokalemia and bradycardia, an abnormality called the U wave becomes noticeable on the ECG.\n",

It also mentions the role of nervous system tone (NST) and afterload (A.S) in cardiac function. The final volume (fin) and contraction of the left ventricle (COLE) are related to contractility. Changes in contractility can affect stroke volume (SV), cardiac output/venous return (CO/VR), and right atrial pressure (RAP). Systemic pressure (S fe) is also mentioned.\n",
